### Sphinx Documentation

The `docs` directory contains the needed file to automatically generate code documentation using Sphinx.

#### Configuration

To change the Sphinx configuration, change the attributes in `source/conf.py`.
The documentation uses `source/_static` to keep the custom media, stylesheets, js scripts etc.
`source/index.rst` is the main rst file in which the look of the index HTML page is defined.

#### Build

The make script generates the documentation using sphinx-build.
The generated documentation is stored in `build/html/`.

##### Linux

```bash
$ poetry install
